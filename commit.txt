Added command-line flags & crystal resolution MCSS filtering

Command-line flags added: 
	(i) '--pdbdb' should point to a local copy
	of the wwPDB.
	(ii) '--crystalpH' should point to
	new_release_crystallization_ph.tsv file 

Crystal resolution MCSS filtering:
	Added functionality to sort ligand-bound BLAST hits, which are
	docking candidates in the largest and smallest MCSS category, by decreasing
	crystal structure resolution. These additions ensure that only the
	highest resolution crystal structures bound to ligands with the largest
	and smallest MCSS (to the candidate BLAST query) will be reported for
	subsequent docking.
 
	
d3r/blast/hit.py: added the static method set_pdb_dir to accommodate
input from the '--pdbdb' command-line flag.

d3r/blast/ligand.py: minor edits

d3r/blast/query.py: added the instance variable 'exp_ph,' to the Query
class, to store crystalization pH conditions.

d3r/filter/filter.py: modified the CandidateFilter class to filter
candidates for largest and smallest MCSS by decreasing crystal structure
resolution. 

d3r/filter/filter_sets.py: minor edits

d3r/utilities/analysis.py: minor edits

d3r/utilities/in_put.py: added the functions 'read_ph' and 'add_ph' to
proccess the new_release_crystallization_ph.tsv file (passed in by new
--crystalpH flag) and add the information to an appropriate instance of
the Query class.

d3r/utilities/io_parser.py: added '--pdbdb' and '--crystalpH'
command-line flags.

d3r/utilities/out_put.py: minor edits

d3r/utilites/run.py: made changes to accomodate the new '--pdbdb' and
'--crystalpH' command-line flags.

d3r/utilites/writers.py: (i) added the class WriteText, which writes
PDBID.txt files, to Shuai's specs., for each elected docking candidate
(ii) in the 'summary.txt' file, the 'sequence' heading was changed to
read 'entries.'
